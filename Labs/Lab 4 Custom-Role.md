# !!! This Lab is NOT complete yet as of 4/26/23, it's being worked on as time permits, stay tuned !!!

# Overview
In this Lab we are going to create a custom role with various Chaos actions and take a look at what the user experiences when they have access to the various actions.  Doing this in a hands-on lab is the best way to learn and lets you see first-hand what the user will experience.
