# About this workshop
The hands-on-labs found on this site will guide you through the process of creating experiments with **Azure Chaos Studio**. I will also go over the fundimental concepts of Chaos Engineering, providing known **good practices** as well as a providing you with a document that provides **guiding principles**.  The goal is bring customers and partners to a 200-level understanding of how to leverage Azure Chaos Studio for Chaos Engineering. This is meant to be a hands on lab experience, all instructions are provided, but a basic level of understanding of Azure and RBAC are needed.

You can download or read the **Chaos Engineering - Guiding Principles** document by [clicking here](/assets/docs/Chaos%20Engineering%20-%20Guiding%20Principles%20-%20Rickcau.pdf/){:target="_blank"}.

You can learn more about the **Azure Chaos Studio** product by [clicking here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/chaos-studio/){:target="_blank"}.

This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a Jekyll site that uses the [Just the Docs] theme. You can easily set the created site to be published on [GitHub Pages] – the [README] file explains how to do that, along with other details.

If [Jekyll] is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site *locally*. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.[^1] And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages.

More specifically, the created site:

- uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem
- uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages

Other than that, you're free to customize sites that you create with this template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of `just-the-docs` and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins.

[Browse our documentation][Just the Docs] to learn more about how to use this theme.

To get started with creating a site, just click "[use this template]"!

If you want to maintain your docs in the `docs` directory of an existing project repo, see [Hosting your docs from an existing project repo](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template/blob/main/README.md#hosting-your-docs-from-an-existing-project-repo) in the template README.
